Description: UFW log analyzer for security monitoring
 UFWInspector is a tool that analyzes UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) logs
 to identify potential security threats. It groups events by type,
 deduplicates entries by IP address, resolves domain names, and
 presents results in a sorted table by number of occurrences.
 .
 Features:
  * Analyzes UFW logs from /var/log/ufw.log
  * Groups events by type (UFW_BLOCK, UFW_AUDIT, etc.)
  * Deduplicates entries by IP address
  * Resolves domain names for IP addresses
  * Identifies whether public addresses are source or destination
  * Presents results in a sorted table
